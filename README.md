# ColorSorter
This project is about an ev3 robot that sorts lego pieces based on their color

An additional feature to this is that it uses the sequence of the colors of the lego pieces as the letters of a word in wordle
    -there is a specific color sequence used (e.g RGGB ) 
    -The user has to then guess the sequence by making a random 4 lego piece sequence and the robot would sort the pieces into 3 piles
    -The first pile would be the piece in the right position and right color
    -second pile is the right color wrong position
    -last pile is the wrong color wrong position
